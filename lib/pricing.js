/* What a framed piece costs.
 *
 * This is the centre of the whole system. In a print shop a price is looked
 * up; in a framing shop it is worked out, from the size of the thing in front
 * of you, every single time. Get this wrong and every quote, invoice, job
 * ticket and profit figure downstream is wrong with it.
 *
 * The rules encoded here are the ones a framer applies by hand:
 *
 *   - the mount grows the glass, and everything cut to the glass grows too;
 *   - moulding is bought by the metre but consumed by the perimeter PLUS the
 *     mitres, which depend on how wide the moulding is;
 *   - glazing, board and backing are priced by area;
 *   - labour is per piece, not per metre;
 *   - and below a certain size nobody works for what the formula says, so a
 *     minimum charge floors the lot.
 *
 * Two things this module refuses to do, on purpose:
 *
 *   1. It never reads the database. Prices come in as arguments, so this can
 *      be tested exhaustively without a schema, and so a quote can be priced
 *      against yesterday's price list as easily as today's.
 *
 *   2. It returns a full breakdown, not just a number. That breakdown is
 *      SNAPSHOTTED onto the job when it is accepted. A quote given in August
 *      must still explain itself in October, after the moulding price has
 *      risen — recomputing an old quote from today's prices silently rewrites
 *      history and turns an argument with a customer into one you lose.
